            <h1><i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> My name is Devon Hornsby</h1>
            <p>I live in Springfield Missouri and currently attend Ozark's Technical Community College. I'm 20 years old and after I recieve my associate's degree I plan to pursue my bachelor's as well as my master's degree at the University of Missouri. The degree I want to obtain is a Computer Science degree. I also intend to learn at least two foreign languages before I graduate from university. When I recieve my degree I want to join a company who specialize in video game creation. After getting some experience I want to create a game of my own with some of my friends, who share the same passion.</p>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Why Computer Science?
            </h1>
            <p>
                I plan to major in computer science simply because of my love for creation and video games. I know it might sound shallow and cliche, but from the moment I graduated highschool and had an obsession with games I knew I wanted it to be a part of my professional career. Ever since I was a teenager I've been enamored with indie devs who created some of my favorite games, those being, Hollow Knight and Darkest Dungeon. Because of these two games it made me realize the potential of my own creativity when it comes to game making and pursuing my degree.

                <i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Why the University of Missouri?
            </h1>
            <p>
                My desire to attend the University of Missouri comes strictly from their scholarships opportunities and their strong reputation with my degree of choice. Mizzou has some of the best transfer scholarships available to someone who's currently attending a community college. They also have one of the strongest Computer Science programs in the state, only superseded by schools like S&T.
